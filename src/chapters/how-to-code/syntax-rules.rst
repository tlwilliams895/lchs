Syntax Rules
============

At their core, programming languages are collections of rules that allow us to
tell a computer what to do. Actions like *Repeat ____ 25 times*, *Prompt the
user for a password*, or *Display text on the screen* can be done with any
language. However, each one uses a different approach to complete the tasks.

.. index:: ! syntax

**Syntax** refers to the rules and structure of a language. For example, in
English, a sentence must begin with a capital letter and end with proper
punctuation.

Python and other languages can only run a program if it is *syntactically
correct*. Even tiny mistakes will cause a program to crash. While humans are
good at overlooking minor errors, computers cannot do the same.

For example, the following phrases are badly written, but we as humans can
still understand them. We might need to read them out loud several times, but
we will eventually get the point.

#. *Peas on urth*
#. *Whirled wor too*
#. *I awlyas thot slpeling was ipmorantt*

Other examples include vanity license plates:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Plate
     - Meaning
   * - KC ROKS
     - Kansas City (or Casey?) Rocks
   * - 4EVERL8
     - Every parent who ever needed to get their kids to practice

Computers cannot overlook mistakes like humans. Any syntax errors, no matter
how small, will prevent the code from running. Instead of trying to work around
the issue, the program will immediately crash and generate error messages.
