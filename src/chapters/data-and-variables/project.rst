Project: Data & Variables
=========================

In this project, you are going to write code to display a fictional
**Launch Checklist**, which includes information about the spaceship,
astronauts, and fuel.

Before You Start
----------------

If your teacher uses repl.it *classroom*, follow these instructions [INSERT
TEXTBOOK LINK!!!!] to access this project.

If you are working through this material on your own, use this standard
repl to access the starter code. [INSERT LINK HERE!!!]

Declare and Assign Variables
----------------------------

Declare and assign a variable for every data point listed below.

.. list-table::
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Variable
     - Value
   * - ``date``
     - Monday 2019-03-18
   * - ``time``
     - 10:05:34 AM
   * - ``average_astronaut_mass_kg``
     - 80.7
   * - ``fuel_mass_kg``
     - 760,000
   * - ``ship_mass_kg``
     - 74842.31
   * - ``fuel_level``
     - 100%

Collect User Input
------------------

Prompt the user to enter for the following information, and store each response
in its own variable:

#. The number of astronauts in the crew (1 - 7).
#. The crew status (``Ready`` or ``Not Ready``).

Mass Calculations
-----------------

Create variables to store the following values:

#. The total mass of the crew (number of astronauts * average astronaut mass).
#. The total mass of the ship (mass of crew + mass of ship + mass of fuel).

.. admonition:: Warning

   Remember to let your code do the calculations! Do NOT hard-code a number for
   either mass value.
   
   For example, if you try to use ``total_crew_mass = 242.1``, then your
   program works correctly ONLY IF the user enters ``3`` for the number of
   astronauts.

Generate the Checklist
----------------------

Display the checklist in the console using your variables.

The generated report should look like the example below---including spaces and
symbols (-, >, and \*).

Example Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note that your output will change if you assign different values to the
variables, or if the user enters different values when prompted.

The point is to AVOID coding specific values into the ``print`` statements. Use
your variable names instead!
