Best Practices: Learning To Code
=================================

For years, the education community has debated the best approach for
*homework*. Should it be scored or not? What is the proper amount? Should
it be even be assigned? So far, no single answer has been found.

We won't open the debate here. Instead, here are a few simple facts for this
course:

#. Yes, there is homework, which consists of prep work, exercises, and
   longer projects.
#. You do not have to do the ungraded practice, but you absolutely *SHOULD*.

The rest of this page is our attempt to motivate you to complete ALL of the
work for this class. How big of a push you need depends on your
personality. Read the sections that are most likely to encourage you.

   "Thanks, but you had me at, 'Do all the homework.' "

If this is your thinking, then bless you. Skip to the best practices listed
in the last section of this page. *You're awesome!*

Otherwise, on to the motivation...

An Appeal to Wisdom
--------------------

.. pull-quote::

   I hear, and I forget.
   I see, and I remember.
   I do, and I understand.
   - Chinese Proverb

Experience is definitely the best teacher. You could read pages and pages about
``for`` loops, which will give you the vocabulary. However, until you build your
first working loop, your understanding will be incomplete.

.. tip::

   You learn to code by CODING. *Do your homework*.

Personal Drive (Grit)
---------------------

Does the following statement sound like you? If so, perfect.

.. pull-quote::

   "If I stumble, I WILL pick myself up, brush off the dust, and try again."

During this course, you will be asked to code. Each exercise and project is
designed to give you experience. You WILL make mistakes, and that is OK. Often,
our mistakes teach us more than getting the correct answer on our first try.

Every genius programmer you see on Facebook or YouTube started out in front of
a screen saying, "Oops," "ARGH!" or "#*&%%@#!" No one just "gets" coding
without some trial-and-error.

.. tip::

   Use your mistakes as learning opportunities. *Do your homework*.

Effort = Outcome
-----------------

Let's take a look at a sample coding task: *"Prompt the user to enter a number,
then print 'Even' if it is divisible by 2, otherwise print 'Odd'."*

Now let's take a look at an imaginary student's attempt at solving this
problem:

::

   1.
   2.
   3.
   4.
   5.

Hmmm. A blank space. What might be the reason?

#. The student did not understand how to solve the problem.
#. The student knew how to solve the problem and decided to skip it.
#. The student tried to solve the problem, could not get their program to work,
   so deleted the code.
#. The student ran out of time trying to complete the work before class.

From a teacher's perspective, ANY of these reasons could be valid, and they
have no way of knowing which is true. This prevents them from knowing how to
best help the student. Where would they begin?

For the student, a blank response provides no benefit! The practice was either
ignored or incomplete. Students gain only as much as they put in. SO:

#. Even if you have no clue how to solve the problem, MAKE AN ATTEMPT ANYWAY,
   then ask questions.
#. If you know how to solve the problem, COMPLETE THE TASK ANYWAY. Practice
   makes better. Also, you could use your code to help a classmate.
#. If you tried to solve the problem, but your code did not work, DO NOT
   DELETE IT. Ask a question. Showing your work to your teacher or classmates
   will show them your thought process.
#. If you ran out of time, GO BACK AND FILL IN THE BLANKS LATER. Practice makes
   better. If you neglect one set of skills, later tasks that depend on those
   skills will become harder.

.. tip::

   Learning takes work, and you need the practice. *Do your homework*.

Marathon Analogy
----------------

Pretend you are not a runner (complete with the "0.0" sticker on your car),
but you decide to compete in a marathon. You cannot just drive to the
starting line, put on your running shoes and go.

You have to train:

#. Begin by getting good at running 1 mile.
#. Then get good at running 3 miles.
#. Then get good at running 6, then 8, then 10 miles. By now you could try a
   half-marathon, and proudly slap a "13.1" sticker on your car.
#. Continue training and increasing your distance. You WILL earn that "26.2"
   sticker, which will look GREAT when placed in line with 0.0 and 13.1.
#. Your stickers demonstrate your commitment and might even inspire other
   non-runners. They will see how you started "just like them" and notice how
   your effort spurred personal growth.

Learning to code follows the same idea:

#. Begin with "Hello world!"
#. Then learn variables, strings and lists.
#. Then learn if/else statements and loops, followed by functions and modules.
#. Then code your first "half-marathon".
#. Continue practicing to increase your skills. You WILL earn that
   marathon.py sticker as you build more projects.
#. Welcome, fellow coder. Don't forget to inspire others.

.. tip::

   *Do your homework*, and you will consistently get better.

Best Practices
---------------

*Whew!*  You made it to the bottom of the page. Good job. Here are some final
bits of advice:

#. DO try every exercise and practice problem.
#. Practice helps you master the basic quirks for a given programming language.
#. DO experiment. Once you solve one given task, feel
   free to tweak it. Great fun can be had if you ask, "What if I try ____,"
   and then go and do just that. For example, if a problem asks you to
   sort a list alphabetically, can you order it from z to a instead?
#. ASK FOR HELP when you get stuck. We've all been there, and there is
   no shame in looking for tips. Use your teacher, classmates, and Google as
   the brilliant resources they are.
#. The only "dumb questions" are the ones that are not asked.
#. The rubber duck method works. Sometimes just describing a coding problem out
   loud (to your screen, a parent, the wall, or a rubber duck) sparks an idea
   about how to solve it.
#. DO NOT copy/paste answers. There are plenty of websites that post
   complete code. A simple copy/paste into the assignment box will give you a
   correct answer, but you completely skipped your chance to learn something.
